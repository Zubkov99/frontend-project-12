# Slack SPA

I wrote a real-time application on React/Redux using AJAX, REST API, websockets (socket.io), React (with hooks) + Redux (@redux/toolkit) + Formik.

**The goal of the project**: to develop an analogue of Slack chat (a very simplified version)


The project is based on technologies used in everyday work by frontend developers in general and React developers in particular. Its purpose is to show the range of all standard tasks that you will have to face in real life. Among them: working with websockets, interacting with the REST API, using React (with hooks), Redux (via reduxjs/toolkit), routing on the client, authorization and authentication, and, of course, assembly (webpack) and deployment.
